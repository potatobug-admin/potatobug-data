=== a. Prophet Muhammad's Morality and Actions

[.argument]
*Argument*: Rob questions the Prophet's relationships with married women, suggesting potential conflicts with Islamic teachings on adultery.

*Reference*: Quran 4:24 discusses lawful and prohibited relationships.

[quote, Quran 4:24]
وَالْمُحْصَنَاتُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ إِلَّا مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُكُمْ ۖ كِتَابَ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ ۚ وَأُحِلَّ لَكُم مَّا وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَن تَبْتَغُوا بِأَمْوَالِكُم مُّحْصِنِينَ غَيْرَ مُسَافِحِينَ


[quote, Quran 4:24, English Translation]
And [also prohibited to you are all] married women except those your right hands possess. [This is] the decree of Allah upon you. And lawful to you are [all others] beyond these, provided that you seek them [in marriage] with [gifts from] your property, desiring chastity, not unlawful sexual intercourse.

أَفَغَيْرَ اللَّهِ أَبْتَغِي حَكَمًا وَهُوَ الَّذِي أَنزَلَ إِلَيْكُمُ الْكِتَابَ مُفَصَّلًا


[quote, Quran 6:114, English]
Then is it other than Allah I should seek as judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?

لَقَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولٌ مِّنْ أَنفُسِكُمْ عَزِيزٌ عَلَيْهِ مَا عَنِتُّمْ حَرِيصٌ عَلَيْكُم بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ رَءُوفٌ رَّحِيمٌ


[quote, Quran 9:128, English]
There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; [he is] concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful.


[quote, Quran 9:129, Arabic]
فَإِن تَوَلَّوْا فَقُلْ حَسْبِيَ اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۖ عَلَيْهِ تَوَكَّلْتُ وَهُوَ رَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ


[quote, Quran 9:129, English]
But if they turn away, [O Muhammad], say, 'Sufficient for me is Allah; there is no deity except Him. On Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Great Throne.'
