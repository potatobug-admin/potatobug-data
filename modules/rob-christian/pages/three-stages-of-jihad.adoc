== Detailed Argument List


=== Arguments

[.argument]
*What is the basis for claiming Islam is a religion of peace?*
Rob questions the claim that Islam is fundamentally peaceful, suggesting that the term _Islam means peace_ **is misleading**. Rob continues to argue that Islamic doctrine **supports violence**, and this claim is presented as contradictory to popular interpretations of Islam.

[.argument]
*How do Islamic sources discuss peace and conflict?*
To support this line of questioning, the Rob references various Quranic verses, such as **Surah 4:34 and Surah 9:5**. He argues that these verses reveal Islamic perspectives on the use of violence.

=== Statements

*Islam as a Contradictory Religion*
Rob suggests that characterizing Islam as peaceful contradicts what they interpret as specific verses and teachings within Islamic doctrine. In Surah 9:5, often called the **Verse of the Sword**, is presented as evidence of Islamic endorsement of violence, **abrogating earlier, peaceful teachings.**

*The Role of Early Islamic History in Defining Islam’s Nature*
Rob discusses early Islamic history, citing territorial conquests and conflicts, suggesting that the early spread of Islam involved aggressive expansion. This is evidence that **Islam’s foundational texts support militant actions**.
